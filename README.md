# Raytracer

I coded the raytracer for this project following the raytracing series by Peter Shirley at: https://raytracing.github.io/
The goal of the project is to research the possibility of using a neural network to raytrace a 3D scene in realtime. This will be accomplished by generating training data using the Raytracer and using a deep learning library such as tensorflow to train a the neural network. The hope is to run the neural network on a webbrowser using tensorflow.js.
